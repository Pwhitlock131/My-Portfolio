# My-Portfolio

This is a website showcasing what I have learned so far in my coding bootcamp. It has links that can take you to an 'About Me', 'My Work', and 'Contact Me' section of the page with relevent information regarding those topics. Includes a picture that doubles as a link to my first homework assignment.
